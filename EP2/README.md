## Directory Structure
The notebook [EP2_notebook1_MAC0417](https://github.com/mathjug/MAC0417-Project/blob/main/EP2/EP2_notebook1_MAC0417.ipynb)
should be placed in the same directory as the [images](https://github.com/mathjug/MAC0417-Project/tree/main/EP2/images)
folder, which contains the dataset and the CSV with the metadata.

The present repository is already structured according to these guidelines, ensuring that the Jupyter Notebook
can be executed successfully. Therefore, after cloning the repository, no changes to the directory structure
are necessary.
