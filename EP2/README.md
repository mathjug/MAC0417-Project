# EP2

## Directory Structure
Notebooks 1 and 2 should be placed in the same directory as the [images](https://github.com/mathjug/MAC0417-Project/tree/main/EP2/images) folder. Running these notebooks will generate multiple subfolders within this directory, each representing a distinct dataset. Additionally, each dataset may contain further subfolders corresponding to different augmentation techniques. Alongside each folder containing images, there exists a corresponding CSV file storing metadata specific to those images. Thus, for organizational purposes, metadata is distributed across multiple CSV files rather than consolidated into a single file.

The repository is already structured in accordance with these specifications, ensuring that the Jupyter Notebooks can be executed without requiring any modifications to the directory structure upon cloning.
