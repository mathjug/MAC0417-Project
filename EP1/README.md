## Directory Structure
The notebook [EP1_MAC0417](https://github.com/mathjug/MAC0417-Project/blob/main/EP1/EP1_MAC0417.ipynb)
should be placed in the same directory as the [Images](https://github.com/mathjug/MAC0417-Project/tree/main/EP1/Images)
folder, which contains the dataset. The *Images* folder must be organized into multiple subfolders, with
each subfolder corresponding to a distinct class in the dataset.

The present repository is already structured according to these guidelines, ensuring that the Jupyter Notebook
can be executed successfully. Therefore, after cloning the repository, no changes to the directory structure
are necessary.
